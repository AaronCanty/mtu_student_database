MTU Database System

Created for the Orient Objected Programming module in my second year at MTU.

This is a student database system, built with the Java language, using the JavaFX SDK. 

The most important learning outcomes were to get a sense of the MVC design pattern, to get a handle on ArrayLists, file saving/loading and the Javadoc system.
